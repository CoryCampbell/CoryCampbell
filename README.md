Hi, I’m Cory Campbell! 

I'm from Weatherford, TX and I’m currently studying Full-Stack Development at App Academy! 
I’m looking forward to collaborating on new projects and expanding my programming network of friends!
I’m interested in all aspects of software engineering, website development, 
computer science, game development, music production, and other similar types of fields.
  
Currently we are getting our online presences ready for the job search!
